An IOS mobile application to display SFV character frame data.
Utilizes the [frda.js API](https://github.com/jpgnotgif/frda.js)

## Why was this built?

1. I want a programatic way to access frame data for the games that I :heart to play.
2. I want a way to expose myself to unused technolog(y||ies)
3. I want to introduce myself to mobile development

## Bootstrap

  1. Get the [frda.js API](https://github.com/jpgnotgif/frda.js) running
  2. Install packages from ```package.json``` via ```npm install
     --save```
  3. Run ```npm start```
  4. Run ```react-native run-ios --no-packager```

## Note
